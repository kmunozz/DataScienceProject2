# Analyzing Factors Influencing Injury Severity in Montgomery County Traffic Collisions

### Project Description

Traffic collisions are a leading cause of injuries and fatalities worldwide, posing significant challenges to public safety. This project seeks to understand the factors contributing to the severity of injuries in traffic collisions, which is crucial for improving road safety and implementing effective preventive measures. 

The dataset used in this analysis is collected from Montgomery County, Maryland, through the Automated Crash Reporting System (ACRS) and is available at [this link](https://data.montgomerycountymd.gov/Public-Safety/Crash-Reporting-Drivers-Data/mmzv-x632/about_data). It contains detailed information about 188,800 traffic collisions, with 39 variables covering various aspects of each crash, including environmental conditions, vehicle characteristics, and road factors.

In this project, the following predictor variables are analyzed:

- **Speed Limit:** The posted speed limit at the location of the crash.
- **Weather:** Weather conditions during the crash, such as clear, cloudy, rainy, or snowy.
- **Surface Condition:** The condition of the road at the time of the crash, including dry, wet, icy, or snow-covered.
- **Vehicle Body Type:** The types of vehicles involved in the crash, such as passenger cars, trucks, buses, or motorcycles.

The target variable is **Injury Severity**, which categorizes the injury outcomes into levels such as no apparent injury, minor injury, serious injury, and fatal injury. The goal of this analysis is to identify patterns and factors that significantly influence injury severity in traffic collisions by exploring the relationships between the predictor variables and the target variable.

This project uses machine learning, specifically classification models, to predict injury severity based on the selected predictor variables. The insights gained from this analysis aim to contribute to better understanding and improving road safety.
